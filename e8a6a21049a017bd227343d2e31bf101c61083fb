Before the refactoring, everything was working fine ... seems strange to me that all of the sudden Gson stopped working with Scala case classes :-(\n\nThe introduction of Lift formatter has lost as well all the Gerrit\u0027s Gson settings for the JSON field naming. Falling back to Gson unless we have a very good reason for changing the serialiser to something else :-)",
